Mind you, these challenges are from FCC. Personally, they're very very easy on data structures,
and many important data structures such as trees and their variations, graphs,
and so on, aren't covered.


Personally, I think the Intermediate module has more interesting challenges. First timers are advised to head on
to websites like UVA Online Judge, HackerRank, and so on, so to gather as much needed programming and problem solving experience as possible. Visualgo also covers some DSs and uses JS. And of course, there are many excelent books on this topic.
